* Version 1.0 [3/5]
  "Working"
  - [X] Tools [2/2]
    - [X] Makefile
    - [X] Unit tests
  - [-] Process and actor naming [3/5]
    - [X] Make configurable, probably with a wrapper around wactor_channel.
    - [X] Application should not start locker.
      It is up to the lib user to start and configure the locking service
    - [ ] Callback for timeout, to refresh the locks.
    - [X] Locker [2/2]
      - [X] Make primary / read copy configurable
      - [X] Make all args to locker start_link/4 configurable.
    - [ ] Write module for erlang local registry (for tests).
  - [X] Actors [1/1]
    - [X] How should we return from a command.
      If actor_response record use it as that, otherwise its a state.
  - [-] Storage [2/3]
    - [X] Insert hooks for read and write
    - [X] Make storage configurable
    - [ ] Write module for ets (for tests).
  - [X] Timeout [1/1]
    - [X] Which way is more efficient? gen_server timeout or timer:send_after
      gen_server timeout seems to scale better with more cores.
      For a when saturating 3 cores, the difference was not so big.
